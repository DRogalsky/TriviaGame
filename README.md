## Challenges

Im not nearly as happy with this one and will probably come back to fix it later.

A mixture of the starwars game taking a lot of my brain power out of me combined with trying to do this with as little jQuery as possible originally cause of a misunderstanding I had with the requirements. I was left doing the easier project in the end just so I could turn something in. That being said there are a couple things I'm happy with.

I ended up getting the answer that was clicked in a fairly roundabout way. I looked in the object returned from the click and just kinda went through it till I found one of the properties that had the text content in it and pulled that into a variable that I then checked against the correct property in the question objects.

The timer is something I'm also pretty proud of even though it's nothing much. Figuring out what it should start and stop with took a bit more planning. I'm happy with how it ended up though.
